# Semester Creator
 Allows me to create folders for my classes quickly.

## Some info
 This is just a small project that I can use to create all of the 
 folders for my classes in just a few seconds. Simply run the program 
 with command arguments containing a path, then main folder, then class 
 names. Add a -l to add a lab folder to the class as well.
